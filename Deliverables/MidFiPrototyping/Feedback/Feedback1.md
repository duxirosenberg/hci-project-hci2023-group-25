# Feedback Interview Group 31

The following is a transcript of the feedback group 31 gave us. 

## Login Screen
Not much to say - seems to be well thought of. 

## Shopping List

- What does the "!" mean ?  -> it seems it is not clear that some items are priorities.
- Adding an item: 
    - It is not intuitive from the start where it is you need to add an item    (the top bar looks like a button)
    - Categories look like buttons, maybe change UI a little


## Task/Chore Manager
- "Bell" Icon  -> is not directly clear that clicking this causes to send notification to asignee
- collapse feature is not really obvious from the start


## Other features
Dont build a communication feature, everybody uses Whatsapp anyways.

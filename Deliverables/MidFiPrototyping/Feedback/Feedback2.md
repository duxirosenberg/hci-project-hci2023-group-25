## Shopping List
- How is the Category assigned? -> at first LLM , then reassign manually 


## Task/Chore Manager
- regular chores: Make it possible to change assigning policy (change from round-robin to setting to a fixed person)
- collapsing feature was not obvious from the design
- NEW IDEA: in a normal household, chores are usually pretty similar and do not change as much. Add some default recommendations for when setting up the flat. Those should be modifiable, but save a lot of time in the signup process and help the user understand how to use the app when first using it. 

## Other Things talked about
This course values the process very much. How we brainstorm, prototype, and so and and how we iterate is very important. There should be a recurring pattern and it should be clear to see how the idea evolved.

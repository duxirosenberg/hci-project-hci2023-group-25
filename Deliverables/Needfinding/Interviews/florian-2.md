4. Different standards when it comes to chores, not a lot of quiet time, can be turbulent

## Communication and Coordination:
1. It is important to clarify in advance what expectations, needs, and demands the other person or persons have for the shared living arrangement before moving in. Additionally, it is crucial to address financial aspects definitively in advance. If there are problems, they should be discussed openly and constructively.
2. In my previous shared flat, a lot of the housework ended up falling on me. On one hand, this was because I had a higher need for order and cleanliness. On the other hand, it was also because the others didn't always stick to the chore schedule. This was very frustrating for me, especially because the situation didn't improve much even after I addressed it. Among other things, this is one reason why I no longer want to live in a shared flat with more than 2 people. The more people are involved, the greater the potential for disagreements.

## Maintenance and Cleaning:
1.  Old shared flat (there were a total of 4 people):
-  Tasks were assigned on a weekly rotation.
- Chores were divided into the following areas: kitchen, bathroom, floors, miscellaneous (e.g., garbage).
- There's a plan on the fridge where you mark your completion after finishing a task. This way, you have a better overview of what has actually been done and what hasn't.

New shared flat (only two people):
- No fixed schedule, tasks are discussed and coordinated.
- Task allocation depends on the available time.
- Since there are fewer people present, there is also less to do. We have very similar ideas about household chores, so there is also less work involved.

## Privacy and Personal Space:
1.  Everyone has their own private room that others may not enter, things that aren't meant to be used by others have to be marked
2.  I was away for an extended period, and during that time, one of my roommates entered my room to place her plants there. I then pointed out to her that I would appreciate it if she didn't enter my private room without asking. In response, she apologized, and it didn't happen again.

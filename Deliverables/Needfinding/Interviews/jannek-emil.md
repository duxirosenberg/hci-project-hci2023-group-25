## General User Insights:
1. Rent prices for individual apartments in Zurich are too expensive.
2. On demanding university days, I prefer minimal interaction with my roommates. Therefore, I wait each morning until my roommate (who wakes up at the same time as me) leaves the kitchen and only then go to the kitchen for breakfast. I spend the day at the university and hope to encounter as few roommates as possible in the evening while preparing dinner.
3. You never have to buy toilet paper.
4. It's important to find compromises that satisfy as many of the roommates' needs as possible.

## Communication and Coordination:
1. All communication takes place via WhatsApp or in the kitchen in the evenings.
2. No, very rarely, as all roommates have a lot to do and, as a result, don't spend much time in the flat.
3. We use Flatastic to divide the costs of communal expenses.

## Cost Sharing:
1. We do not share groceries, and utility costs are already included in the rent.
2. No, the division is clear to everyone and is visible in the app.
3. No, I often have to reimburse money for communal expenses because I rarely or never shop for communal products.

## Conflict Resolution:
1. I was never involved in my roommates' conflicts because I'm fine with almost everything.
2. Most roommates have enough private matters to deal with, so there are no conflicts in the community.

## Maintenance and Cleaning:
1. We follow a cleaning schedule that fairly distributes cleaning tasks among all roommates on a weekly basis. Maintenance is taken care of by the management.
2. There are individuals who do not perfectly adhere to the cleaning schedule and often have to catch up on a task from the previous week.

## Privacy and Personal Space:
1. Everyone has their own room, which other roommates are not allowed to enter under any circumstances.
2. No, privacy in individual bedrooms is strictly maintained, which I appreciate.

## Safety and Security:
1. The front door is usually locked, but all rooms in the flat are open.
2. No, I've never known of any such incidents.

## Guests and Visitors:
1. Every guest is welcome, as long as they are respectful and adhere to the house rules
2. No, we rarely have parties, and there have never been problems with individual guests.

## Technology and Tools:
1. Yes, Flatastic.
2. Flatastic solves most problems very well; I have never felt the need for additional features.

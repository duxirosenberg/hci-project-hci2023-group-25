4. Qualitative Feedback

    1. Prefers prototype B; there are less tabs it is generally simpler
    2. | interface | pro | con |
       | --- | --- | --- |
       | A | better filtering/sorting, experienced users can use it more precisely, better overview over other people's tasks | takes more time |
       | B | simpler at first glance, faster to learn, focus on users own tasks | finding the right task is harder |
    3. Interface B but with a "filter by" button
    4. It is not clear that the "Y" stands for "You". Just a small profile picture in the top right corner would already make it clearer.
